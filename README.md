# Team 11205 Edgemont Robotics's Code for the 2021-2022 Freight Frenzy Season
We are most proud of our original motion algorithms, which use logistic curves and exponential decay to minimize jerk (and higher order derivatives) and maximize accuracy. We focus on simplicity, working with hardware from a basic level, and learning.
